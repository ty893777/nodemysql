Okay so I been working on CRUD apps for a mintue now and I've been back in forth in Redis, MySQL and Vue. My minds asking what's next?

  - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
  - Rest was Magic

# Since its an API, You can:
      - CreateDB
        - /createDB
        - /getposts
        - /deleteposts
        - /updateposts

i Made this as a building block to muscle memory for one of those days I might need to build a blog from scratch and send QUERYS to mysql
